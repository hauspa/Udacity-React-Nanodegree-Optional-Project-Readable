# Project Description

Readable web app built using React and Redux. The app communicates with a Node server and saves data in Redux as well as on the server. Users can create posts and comment on a post. Users can also then upvote or downvote a post or comment to their liking. Posts can be shown and filtered by category. 

A project for Udacity's React Nanodegree, with a focus on Redux.
